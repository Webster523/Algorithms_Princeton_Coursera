PA1 went from 91 to 100. Since I introduced two virtual sites to decrease the complexity, this led to a 'backwash' problem. Therefore, another union-find was used to solve this problem. 

PA2 went from 96 to 100.

PA3 was much complicated than previous 2 PAs and I got 99 finally due to the failure in two timing tests.

I got 97 both in PA4 and PA5. For PA4, several tests about the number of used operations failed. For PA5, since I did not use one pruning technique and recursive traverse, I also failed in two tests.
